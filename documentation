TODO:
 - plot scores for first idea (mst + sa tsp + greedy + sa packing) (COMMIT : COMMIT ID) (difference to the values found by the article is close to the difference in tsp efficiency)
 - plot cityWeight
 - observations : solution quality tied to tsp quality
 - => maximize something closer to the ttp in the first phase (finding a good tour without packing) instead
 - document the complexity of data structures
